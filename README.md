# Gravity-simulation
2d gravity simulation of asteroids, one model implemented in parallel and the other with a single processor.
This software presents a simple graphical display to show a simulation of gravity on all these particles on a system. 
Datasets contains the java file to run the software on a single process.
DatasetsParallel contains the java file to run the software in parallel processes.
Test contains the speed tests for the software's speed.
